# Proudest Moment  -  Start 2020 with luck

Hi, this time I wanna share with you all about the proudest moment in my life until now. I have had two lucks at the beginning years, first ones, I finished my studies in 3,5 years, and second ones, I got jobs in one of a big company in Indonesia.

## Finished my studies in 3,5 years.

I'm a college student at Brawijaya University, located in Malang city, East Java far away from my family. You know the most tiring moment of finishing my undergraduate thesis is very difficult to meet my lecturer. I think most students also feel what I feel.
That moment starts in mid-2019 (specifically in the 7th semester). I start to write my undergraduate thesis and my final project. Every day I'm waiting for my lecturer in front of the lecturer room, from 10 AM until 4 PM. There is no day without revision ☹️, but yeaaah, hard work will not betray the results.

## Join to Gojek Indonesia as Go-Troop

Started in November 2019, I start my journey through Campus Hiring Surabaya. From Malang, I with my friend riding a motorcycle to go to Surabaya. On Saturday, we start with the Pair Programming session with Gojek Engineer. Damn, I'm so nervous, It's the first time I try to pair programming. I try to calm and just do what I can do.

After the pairing session, I got an announcement to join the next session on Sunday. The next session is Interview Session, yeah the interview session is ask about daily activity and experience in programming. I remember the interviewer ask me to code on the whiteboard. He gives me some problems (if I remember correctly) the problem is about data structure. Alhamdullilah, I can solve the problem correctly.

After that, I waiting for the announcement for two weeks. Alhamdullilah again, I passed to the final interview. The final interview conducted online by Zoom, and he asks about technical and my experience. After a few weeks, I got a call from Gojek HR. She gives me congrats and said that I passed. Damn, I don't know what to say. I just say "Oh iya kak, thank you", wkwkwk LOL 🤣. It's beyond my expectation because I don't really confident with my skills.

And then On 3rd February 2020, I start my journey in Gojek as Go-Troop. I hope I have the opportunity to give more value to Gojek and Indonesia.
